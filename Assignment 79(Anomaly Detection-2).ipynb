    "In anomaly detection, feature selection can be used to improve the performance of anomaly detection algorithms by removing features \n",

    "\n",
    "There are many different feature selection techniques that can be used in anomaly detection. Some of the most popular techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Correlation-based feature selection: This technique selects features that are highly correlated with the target variable.\n",
    "2. Information gain: This technique selects features that provide the most information about the target variable.\n",
